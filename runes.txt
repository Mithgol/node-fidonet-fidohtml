1. Status of this document
-+------------------------

  This document is a draft of a Fidonet Standards Proposal (FSP).

  This document specifies an optional Fidonet standard
  that can be used in the Fidonet community.

  Implementation of the standard defined in this document is not
  mandatory, but all implementations are expected to adhere
  to this standard.

  Distribution of this document is unlimited, 
  provided that its text is not altered without notice.

2. Introduction
-+-------------

  Hypermedia elements (such as hyperlinks or images) have not been
  initially designed to appear in Fidonet messages: these messages
  have a textual nature.

  This document specifies a lightweight markup that can be used
  for marking up some places in Fidonet messages where an element
  of hypermedia is necessary. Such markings are designed to be
  syntactically distinguishable from the text.

  These elements of lightweight markup are called Fidonet runes.

  Fidonet runes are not based on the systems that heavily utilize
  start tags and end tags (such as HTML or BBCode) because these
  do not have enough lightweightness in them.

  Fidonet runes are based on their Markdown counterparts because
  that markup language (Markdown) is both lightweight and popular.

  There are less Fidonet runes than Markdown markings. That's because
  some Markdown markings correspond to Fidonet features defined
  elsewhere (such as blockquotes, defined in FSC-0032) and also
  because some Fidonet runes are yet to be defined in the future
  versions of this document.

  Some Fidonet runes differ from their Markdown counterparts
  (for example, permit and ignore an extra newline character)
  because Fidonet runes have to deal with limitations of its medium
  (Fidonet lines of text are 78 or 79 characters long traditionally,
  and IBM 80-column punched card format, designed in 1928, seems to be
  the historical cause for that).

3. Key words to indicate requirement levels
-+-----------------------------------------

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
  and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
  in FTA-1006 (based on RFC 2119).

4. Blank characters
-+-----------------

  The following characters are blank characters:

  *) horizontal tab (\t, Unicode U+0009),

  *) line feed (\n, Unicode U+000A),

  *) vertical tab (\v, Unicode U+000B),

  *) form feed (\f, Unicode U+000C),

  *) carriage return (\r, Unicode U+000D),

  *) whitespace (Unicode U+0020),

  *) no-break space (Unicode U+00A0),

  *) Ogham space mark (Unicode U+1680),

  *) Mongolian vowel separator (Unicode U+180E),

  *) general punctuation spaces (Unicode from U+2000 to U+200A),

  *) line separator (Unicode U+2028),

  *) paragraph separator (Unicode U+2029),

  *) narrow no-break space (Unicode U+202F),

  *) medium mathematical space (Unicode U+205F),

  *) ideographic space (Unicode U+3000),

  *) zero width no-break space (Unicode U+FEFF).

  They are used (as explained below) as separators in runes.

5. Fidonet runes of images
-+------------------------

  The Fidonet rune of an image has the following form:

  ![alt text](URL "title")

  where the words "alt text" (without quotes) are replaced by the
  alternative text (which is displayed instead of the image if that
  image itself cannot be displayed), and the word "URL" (without
  quotes) is replaced by the image's URL, and the word "title"
  (in quotes) is replaced by the image's title (which might be shown
  as a tooltip on a mouse's hover or a thumb's long press).

  Example:

  ![Fidonet nodelist chart](https://t.co/8sGOXI2EdB "a gloomy chart")

  Initial and final newline characters in the alternative text MUST be
  ignored. Newline characters elsewhere in the alternative text MUST
  be treated as whitespaces. Therefore authors (and authoring tools)
  MAY insert newlines there to deal with limitations of the medium
  (Fidonet lines of text are 78 or 79 characters long traditionally,
  and IBM 80-column punched card format, designed in 1928, seems to be
  the historical cause for that).

  The alternative text is enclosed in square brackets. Therefore, if
  such text itself contains a closing square bracket ("]" without
  quotes), such bracket MUST be preceded by a backslash in the rune
  (and "\]" without quotes MUST be interpreted as a literal "]"
  character and not as the alternative text's ending).

  The image's title is OPTIONAL. When it is present, it MUST be
  separated (by one or more blank characters, see section 4)
  from the URL.

  The image's title is enclosed in quotes. Double quotation marks
  ("like these") are used instead of single ('like these'). If the
  title itself contains a double quotation mark, such mark MUST be
  preceded by a backslash in the rune (and '\"' without single
  quotation marks MUST be interpreted as a literal '"' character
  and not as the title's ending).

  The image's URL MUST NOT contain a closing parenthesis (the ")"
  character) because that would cause a premature end of the rune.
  Such parenthesis (if it appears in the URL) MUST be URL-encoded
  (presented as "%29" without quotes).

6. Fidonet runes of hyperlinks
-+----------------------------

  The Fidonet rune of a hyperlink has the following form:

  [link text](URL "title")

  where the words "link text" (without quotes) are replaced by the
  hyperlink's text, and the word "URL" (without quotes) is replaced
  by the hyperlink's URL, and the word "title" (in quotes) is replaced
  by the hyperlink's title (which might be shown as a tooltip
  on a mouse's hover or a thumb's long press).

  Example:

  [FTSC's docs](http://ftsc.org/docs/ "Standards, proposals, etc.")

  Initial and final newline characters in the hyperlink's text MUST be
  ignored. Newline characters elsewhere in the hyperlink's text MUST
  be treated as whitespaces. Therefore authors (and authoring tools)
  MAY insert newlines there to deal with limitations of the medium
  (Fidonet lines of text are 78 or 79 characters long traditionally,
  and IBM 80-column punched card format, designed in 1928, seems to be
  the historical cause for that).

  The hyperlink's text is enclosed in square brackets. Therefore, if
  such text itself contains a closing square bracket ("]" without
  quotes), such bracket MUST be preceded by a backslash in the rune
  (and "\]" without quotes MUST be interpreted as a literal "]"
  character and not as the hyperlink's text's ending).

  As an exception to the aforementioned rule, the hyperlink's text MAY
  contain one or several Fidonet runes of images (see the previous
  section), and backslashes are not REQUIRED before the square
  brackets around the images' alternative texts.

  Example:

  [The beginning of a hyperlink.
  ![The first image's alternative text.](https://t.co/8sGOXI2EdB)
  The hyperlink's text continues.
  ![The second image's alternative text.](https://t.co/8sGOXI2EdB)
  The remaining text.](http://example.org/)

  The hyperlink's title is OPTIONAL. When it is present, it MUST be
  separated (by one or more blank characters, see section 4)
  from the URL.

  The hyperlink's title is enclosed in quotes. Double quotation marks
  ("like these") are used instead of single ('like these'). If the
  title itself contains a double quotation mark, such mark MUST be
  preceded by a backslash in the rune (and '\"' without single
  quotation marks MUST be interpreted as a literal '"' character
  and not as the title's ending).

  The hyperlink's URL MUST NOT contain a closing parenthesis (the ")"
  character) because that would cause a premature end of the rune.
  Such parenthesis (if it appears in the URL) MUST be URL-encoded
  (presented as "%29" without quotes).

  If the hyperlink's title starts with a runeword (see the following
  section), then a more complex element of the hypertext SHOULD appear
  instead of the hyperlink.

7. Runewords
-+----------

  Runewords are keywords that MAY appear at the beginning of the title
  in a Fidonet rune of a hyperlink. Such a keyword indicates that
  Fidonet browsers SHOULD display a more complex object instead of
  a plain hyperlink there.

  Runewords are somewhat forward compatible: if an unknown runeword is
  encountered or if a Fidonet browser decides to ignore the runeword,
  then a plain hyperlink MUST be displayed, serving as a fallback.
