1. Status of this document
-+------------------------

  This document is a draft of a Fidonet Standards Proposal (FSP).

  This document specifies an optional Fidonet standard
  that can be used in the Fidonet community.

  Implementation of the standard defined in this document is not
  mandatory, but all implementations are expected to adhere
  to this standard.

  Distribution of this document is unlimited, 
  provided that its text is not altered without notice.

2. Introduction
-+-------------

  Hypermedia elements (such as hyperlinks or images) have not been
  initially designed to appear in Fidonet messages: these messages
  have a textual nature.

  This document specifies a lightweight markup that can be used
  for marking up some places in Fidonet messages where an element
  of hypermedia is necessary. Such markings are designed to be
  syntactically distinguishable from the text.

  These elements of lightweight markup are called Fidonet runes.

  Fidonet runes are not based on the systems that heavily utilize
  start tags and end tags (such as HTML or BBCode) because these
  do not have enough lightweightness in them.

  Fidonet runes are based on their Markdown counterparts because
  that markup language (Markdown) is both lightweight and popular.

  There are less Fidonet runes than Markdown markings. That's because
  some Markdown markings correspond to Fidonet features defined
  elsewhere (such as blockquotes, defined in FSC-0032) and also
  because some Fidonet runes are yet to be defined in the future
  versions of this document.

  Some Fidonet runes differ from their Markdown counterparts
  (for example, permit and ignore an extra newline character)
  because Fidonet runes have to deal with limitations of its medium
  (Fidonet lines of text are 78 or 79 characters long traditionally,
  and IBM 80-column punched card format, designed in 1928, seems to be
  the historical cause for that).

3. Key words to indicate requirement levels
-+-----------------------------------------

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
  and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
  in FTA-1006 (based on RFC 2119).

4. Fidonet runes of images
-+------------------------

  The Fidonet rune of an image has the following form:

  ![alt text](URL "title")

  where the words "alt text" (without quotes) are replaced by the
  alternative text (which is displayed instead of the image if that
  image itself cannot be displayed), and the word "URL" (without
  quotes) is replaced by the image's URL, and the word "title"
  (in quotes) is replaced by the image's title (which might be shown
  as a tooltip on a mouse's hover or a thumb's long press).

  Example:

  ![Fidonet nodelist chart](https://t.co/8sGOXI2EdB "a gloomy chart")

  Initial and final newline characters in the alternative text MUST be
  ignored. Newline characters elsewhere in the alternative text MUST
  be treated as whitespaces. Therefore authors (and authoring tools)
  MAY insert newlines there to deal with limitations of the medium
  (Fidonet lines of text are 78 or 79 characters long traditionally,
  and IBM 80-column punched card format, designed in 1928, seems to be
  the historical cause for that).

  The alternative text is enclosed in square brackets. Therefore, if
  such text itself contains a closing square bracket ("]" without
  quotes), such bracket MUST be preceded by a backslash in the rune
  ("\]" without quotes MUST be interpreted as a literal "]" character
  instead of the alternative text's ending).
